Artists Only is a project designed to test my ability to utilize JavaScript and Rails to create an interactive website for users to collaborate and share art on. 
<!-- In the testing stage, this file will also be used to track the features as they are implemented and tested, non-commented features listed below are complete, some features will be removed as they aren't necessary to be listed for the average user (deleting posts, leaving chatrooms, etc.), these will be marked with an (*) for deletion before deployment -->
On Artists Only, users can:
    - create an account
    <!-- - delete account (*) -->
    - upload images or text: drawings, paintings, random pictures from their phones, short stories or poetry, etc.
    - delete posts (*)
    - other users can comment on posts
    <!-- - users can offer to collaborate with the Original Poster of a post -->
    <!-- - if the OP accepts, the second poster can upload a companion piece to their post, a short story based off of a drawing, extra lines of a poem, a picture they feels go well with a painting -->
    <!-- - these two users will be able to enter a chatroom together, where they can discuss anything about the collaboration (comment: this will be implemented last, as the chatroom will be difficult for me) -->
    <!-- - the OP can finalize their collaboration and publish it to the website -->
    <!-- - users can upvote posts that they like -->
    <!-- - the top rated posts of the week will be displayed in a Hall of Fame at the top of the page -->
